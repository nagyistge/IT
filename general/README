General Server Management/Monitoring Tools

ad-groups.py:
Script that serves as a 'groups' supplement by retrieving a user's associated
groups from Active Directory.

downboy2.c:
This program is invoked periodically via cron and explicitly 'nice's the
priority of jobs exceeding the specified limits. An optional configuration
file (OVERRIDE_FILE) allows specific users to be treated specially, either
excepted from lower priority or accelerated if they're especially annoying.  A
command line option also exists for killing jobs that exceed a specified time
limit.

hearsawho.py:
A sample script illustrating a periodic SNMP poll of two systems for different
statistics and notifying appropriate parties only on a state change.

ldapmon.py:
A sample script illustrating a periodic LDAP poll to determine that a server
is up and responding to queries.  If not, appropriate parties are notified via
email.

nls.c:
Wrapper for ls used to monitor whether execution time is in excess of a
threshold (ALERT_THR).  If so, the transaction is logged to LOGFILE.

wtbmotd.sh:
wtbrun.sh:
wtb.py:
The wtb (Where's the Beef?) script polls a list of systems via SNMP and
returns a list of systems sorted by lowest load, free memory and CPU cores.

By default it looks for a list of systems in ~/wtb_nodelist and 
/usr/local/etc/wtb_nodelist.

It is dependent on having the net-snmp package installed as invocation of this
seems less hacky than using the available Python SNMP packages.

The associated wtbmotd.sh script runs wtb.py and appends its output to a motd
template.  Running this periodically via cron shows users which are the least
used systems when they login.

The associated wtbrun.sh script uses wtb.py to select the least loaded system
and runs a job (specified on the wtbrun.sh command line) on it.
